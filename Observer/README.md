# Observer Design Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets us to define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

If one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

# Application

Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
