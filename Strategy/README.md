# Strategy Design Pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.

# Application

Use the Strategy pattern when we want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
