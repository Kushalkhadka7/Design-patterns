# Factory Design Pattern

## Overview

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. Since it provides one of the ways to create objects it comes under creational design pattern.

In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
