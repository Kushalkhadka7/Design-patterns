# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Application

Use the Abstract Factory when the code needs to work with various families of related products, but don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or simply want to allow for future extensibility.
